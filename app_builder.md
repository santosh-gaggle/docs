# App Builder and Adobe I/O High Level Overview

## What is App Builder?
App Builder is a comprehensive design, application, and runtime framework for building 3rd-party cloud-native applications. These custom web apps run on Adobe infrastructure and extend the functionality of Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Cloud. With App Builder, customers can build custom integrations between Adobe products and 3rd-party products, enabling greater efficiency and improved workflows.

## Availability
App Builder has been available since Dec. 17th, 2021.

## Support
For developer support, we encourage developers to use our forum. Feature requests or bugs can be submitted on our public repositories – CLI repo and SDK repo. Enterprise Customer support is not available during the “Developer Preview” phase.

## Pricing / Licensing
App Builder is available at no cost to enterprise customers and partners for the duration of the Developer Preview. Pricing and licensing details will be announced later this year.

## Target Audience
App Builder is available to Adobe enterprise customers or partners who want to extend and integrate Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Cloud solutions. Currently, it is not available to individual developers who are not part of an Adobe enterprise or partner organization.

## Access
You can apply for access on Adobe’s Prelease forum -> App Builder -> Apply. You will need to provide your Adobe Organization ID and Organization Name, along with a description of your use case.

## Relationship with Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Cloud
App Builder is part of Adobe Experience Platform, under a workstream called Cloud Extensibility, which allows customers and partners to extend the functionality of Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Cloud solutions.

## What's Included?
App Builder offers a complete application framework for extending Adobe solutions, including:
- Support for headful and headless apps
- Default UI toolkit (React-Spectrum)
- CLI and code generators
- SDK libraries to integrate with Adobe solutions
- Enterprise-grade security
- CI/CD pipeline
- Execution environment (serverless platform, CDN, etc.)
- Integration with experience.adobe.com

## Extensibility
App Builder is highly extensible. Developers can customize and extend it to meet their specific use cases and requirements.

## Open Source
The tools used in App Builder development are open source, and developers can submit Pull Requests. Adobe I/O Runtime, which App Builder uses, is built on top of Apache OpenWhisk, another open-source project.

## Relationship with Adobe I/O Runtime
App Builder builds on top of existing Adobe technologies, and Adobe I/O Runtime is one of them. It simplifies the development of Single Page Applications on Adobe I/O Runtime.

## Developer Resources
There are public developer docs, code labs, videos, and webinars available to help developers get started with App Builder.

## Supported Language
The only language supported is JavaScript within the Node.js ecosystem.

## Distribution Control
App Builder enables enterprises to control the application lifecycle (test, publish, unpublish) through Adobe Exchange and manage user access using Adobe enterprise user access control.

## Extending Document Cloud and Creative Cloud
Currently, App Builder focuses on Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Cloud. There are plans to expand to include Document Cloud and Creative Cloud solutions.

## Comparison to Other Frameworks
App Builder is not a generic framework for creating cloud-native apps but is tailored for extending and integrating Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform. It's pre-integrated with Adobe APIs, Events, Adobe I/O Runtime, and Adobe authentication/authorization, making it the fastest and easiest way to extend and integrate with Adobe enterprise solutions.
