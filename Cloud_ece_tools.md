ECS is a container orchestration service used to manage and run Docker containers in the cloud. Magento Commerce Cloud uses ECS for containerized application deployment.

## 3. Fastly CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Fastly is a global CDN that accelerates content delivery to end-users. It caches static assets, reduces server load, and enhances the speed and performance of your online store.

## 4. GitHub Integration

Magento Commerce Cloud integrates with GitHub for version control and code management. Developers can use Git for collaboration, code changes, and deployment.

Configuration files define the infrastructure, services, and environment settings for your store. These files are typically stored in the `.magento/` directory of your project.

## 9. Cloud Environments

Magento Commerce Cloud provides separate environments for development, staging, and production, each with its configuration and resources.

## 10. Branches and Development

Development is usually done in Git branches, and Magento Commerce Cloud allows the creation of separate environments for different branches, simplifying testing and deployment.

## 11. Auto-Scaling

The cloud environment can automatically scale resources based on traffic demands, ensuring your store handles increased traffic during peak periods.

## 12. Deployment Workflow

Magento Commerce Cloud follows a defined deployment workflow, including container building, deployment, testing, and promotion through different environments.

## 13. Cloud SSH Access

Developers can use SSH access to connect to cloud environments for debugging, troubleshooting, and maintenance.
