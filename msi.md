# Multi-Source Inventory (MSI) in Magento 2

Multi-Source Inventory (MSI) is a powerful feature introduced in Magento 2 that allows you to manage your inventory across multiple sources or physical locations. This feature is especially beneficial for merchants with multiple warehouses, brick-and-mortar stores, or dropshipping operations. Here's an overview of MSI in Magento 2:

1. **Why MSI?**

   - **Multi-Location Inventory Management:** MSI enables you to track and manage inventory quantities across various sources or locations, including warehouses, stores, and suppliers.

   - **Enhanced Inventory Accuracy:** It provides real-time inventory updates, reducing the risk of overselling and improving order fulfillment accuracy.

   - **Order Routing:** You can configure rules to determine the source from which an order should be fulfilled based on factors like proximity to the customer or product availability.

   - **Inventory Reservation:** MSI supports inventory reservation to ensure that stock is available for customers who have added items to their carts.

2. **Key Concepts:**

   - **Sources:** Sources represent physical locations where your products are stocked. These can include warehouses, stores, or other places where you store inventory.

   - **Stocks:** Stocks are associated with sources and represent the available inventory for specific product quantities at a particular source. You can have multiple stocks associated with different sources.

   - **Salable Quantity:** This is the quantity of a product that is available for sale and is calculated based on the sum of quantities across all sources.

3. **Configuration:**

   - To start using MSI, you need to configure sources, stocks, and assign products to specific sources in the Magento Admin Panel.

   - Define shipping and priority settings to determine how orders should be fulfilled.

   - **Brick-and-Mortar Stores:** It helps retailers with physical stores to manage in-store and online inventory seamlessly.

   - **Dropshipping:** Merchants using dropshipping can manage their suppliers as separate sources, ensuring accurate tracking of supplier inventory.

5. **Extensions and Customization:**

   - MSI can be extended and customized to meet specific business requirements. Magento's modular architecture allows for the development of custom modules to enhance MSI functionality.

6. **Integration:**

   - When integrating with third-party systems like ERPs or order management systems, MSI plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate inventory synchronization.

7. **Benefits:**

   - Improved inventory accuracy and reduced overselling.
